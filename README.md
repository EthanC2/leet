# leet - a leetspeak converter
Leetspeak is a language in hacker culture that uses a modified Latin alphabet. To
translate into leetspeak, you replace certain letters (usually vowels) with numbers
or symbols. For example, "haxor" (slang for "hacker") becomes "h4x0r" or "h4x02". Since
leetspeak is an informal language, there are multiple valid translations for each letter.
The letter 'H' could be translated as "#", "/-/", "]-[", "I+I", and many more.

Although leetspeak traditionally uses ASCII, you can use extended ASCII or even Unicode. 
This tool supports three levels of leetspeak, each more difficult to read for laymen than 
the last. Support for custom mapping is planned and under development.
